# Project 1 Rubric

Prepare a  markdown  with **three** columns:

- Column1 has all the following points PLUS all the  points from the
  [Software Sustainability Evaluation](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf0ccsVdN-nXJCHLluJ-hANZlp8rDKgprJa0oTYiLZSDxh3DA/viewform).
- Column2  is your self-assessment. For each items, score yourself zero (none), one  (a litte),  two (somewhat), three (a lot).
- Column3 is for any links you  are adding to support your claim in column two.
- At the top,  show the sum of column2,


| Notes|evidence|Links|
|-----|---------|------|
|workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others... 
but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)|evidence  in GH|
| Number of commits|in GH|
| Number of commits: by different people|in GH|
| Issues reports: there are **many**|
|  issues are being  closed|evidence in GH|
| DOI badge: exists |in GH|
|Docs: doco generated , format not ugly |in GH|
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) |
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z|doc page entries|
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing|
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|
| Use of version control tools|
|Use of  style checkers |config files in GH showing your config|
| Use of code  formatters. |config files in GH showing your this formatter's  config|
| Use of syntax checkers. |config files iin  GH showing this checker's config  |
| Use of code coverage |config files in GH|
| other automated analysis tools|config files in GH|
| test cases exist|dozens of tests and those test cases are more than 30% of the  code base|
| test cases are routinely executed|e.g. travis-com.com or github actions or something|
 | the files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up|
| issues are discussed before they are closed|even if you discuss in slack, need a sumamry statement here|
| Chat channel: exists|
| test cases:.a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.|if a test case fails, open an issue and fix it|
| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files|
| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)|
| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)|
| evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base|
|short release cycles | (hard to see in short projects) project members are committing often enough so that everyone can get your work|
